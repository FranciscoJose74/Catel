Defines
=======

All debug versions have DEBUG

NET45		NET, NET45
NET46		NET, NET46
NET47		NET, NET47
PCL			PCL

Note that defines must be set for Debug and Release configurations


Output directories
==================

..\..\output\[DEBUG|RELEASE]\[FRAMEWORK]\[PROJECT]

Note that the xml documentation must also be generated


Assembly name and default namespace
===================================

The assembly name is always equal to the project name without the framework
extension. Thus a project named "Catel.Extensions.FluentValidation.NET35" will
have the assembly name "Catel.Extensions.FluentValidation".

The default namespace is always "Catel".


Assembly info
=============

There is one assembly info that should be included by all projects, which
is SolutionAssemblyInfo which is located in Catel.Core.NET35.

Every project (thus Catel.Core, Catel.MVVM, etc) all have a separate AssemblyInfo
that must be located in the NET35 project and referenced by all other projects.
