Defines
=======

All debug versions have DEBUG

NET35		NET, NET35
NET40		NET, NET40
NET45		NET, NET45
SL4			SILVERLIGHT, SL4
SL5			SILVERLIGHT, SL5
WP7			SILVERLIGHT, WINDOWS_PHONE
WINRT		WINRT

Note that defines must be set for Debug and Release configurations


Output directories
==================

..\..\output\[DEBUG|RELEASE]\[FRAMEWORK]\[PROJECT]

Note that the xml documentation must also be generated


Assembly name and default namespace
===================================

The assembly name is always equal to the project name without the framework
extension. Thus a project named "Catel.Extensions.FluentValidation.NET35" will
have the assembly name "Catel.Extensions.FluentValidation".

The default namespace is always "Catel".


Assembly info
=============

There is one assembly info that should be included by all projects, which
is SolutionAssemblyInfo which is located in Catel.Core.NET35.

Every project (thus Catel.Core, Catel.MVVM, etc) all have a separate AssemblyInfo
that must be located in the NET35 project and referenced by all other projects.


Caitlyn
=======

See http://caitlyn.codeplex.com

I have created a tool that makes it easier to create the linked files. So, from now
on you only have to add files to the NET35 project. Then, simply run Caitlyn
via the Visual Studio extension.

It will automatically loop all the files in "Catel.Core.NET35"
and create them in the following projects (if they exist):

* Catel.Core.NET40
* Catel.Core.NET45
* Catel.Core.SL4
* Catel.Core.SL5
* Catel.Core.WP7
* Catel.Core.WinRT

This makes the development a lot easier!
