Catel readme
============

Catel is more than just an MVVM framework. It also includes user controls and lots of 
enterprise library classes. The MVVM framework differs itself from other frameworks of 
the simplicity and solves the "nested user control" problem with dynamic viewmodels for 
user controls.
